SQL code for tables setup. I decided on what information I wanted to keep track of in the database and then created a table for each along with the necessary columns. 
Each table has a PRIMARY KEY and tables 2 and 3 both include a FOREIGN KEY. 
SKILLS PRACTICED:
  - Creating tables
  - Utilizing PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYS

TABLE 1: EMPLOYEES 
The following code creates a table with the following columns: Emplyoee ID, First Name, Last Name, Department, Position, Salary and Hire Date. 

  CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    position VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

TABLE 2: DEPARTMENTS
The following code creates a table with the following columns: Department ID, Department Name and Manager ID.
The manager_id is a foregin key and will link to that managers employee_id in the employee table. 

  CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES Employees(employee_id)
);

TABLE 3: SALES
The following code creates a table with the following columns: Sale ID, Employee ID, Sale Date, Sale Amount and Product Sold. 
The employee_id is a foreign key linked to the employee_id in the employee table. 

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_amount DECIMAL(7, 2),
    product_sold VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employees(employee_id)
);

TABLE 4: PRODUCTS 
The following code creates a table with the following columns: Product ID, Product Name and Price

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(5, 2)
);

TABLE 5: CUSTOMERS
The following code creates a table with the following columns: Customer ID, First Name, Last Name, Email and Phone Number.

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);
